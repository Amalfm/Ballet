   <h1>History </h1>
   <h2>Origin of Ballet</h2>
   <p>Ballet began during the renaissance around the year 1500 in Italy. The term originates from the Italian word 'ballare' , which means to dance . Initially dancers only wore masks, layers of costume and large pantaloons, large headdresses, and ornaments. The dance steps were composed of small hops, slides, curtsies, promenades, and gentle turns. The dancing shoes had small heels and resembled formal dress shoes rather than any contemporary ballet shoe we might recognize today. </p>
  <p>
     <ol>
       <li>Seventeenth Century
          <p>  The introduction of  silks, satins, and fabrics embroidered with stones became more present in ballet costumes.
           The Russians adopted the European ballet designs.  The decorated costumes during this period  reflected  the court and the details presented on the dresses and silhouettes was  exaggerated and creaated to be visible and identifiable for  spectators viewing the performance even from a distance.
         </P>
        </li>

     <li>Eighteenth Century</li>
      <p>During the early eighteenth century, the European ballet  mainly focused in the paris Op√©ra. The stage costumes were very similar to the ones used in court, but  more elaborated.The introduction of more ribbons, flowers and lace started to come into use in order enhance a more feminine style. Whereas the male costumes reflected the Neoclassical style. However, the large wigs and headwear still restricted the mobility and fluidity of the dancers.
        </p>



     <li>Nineteenth Century</li>
<p>
In the early nineteenth century, the ideals of Romanticism were reflected in female stage costumes .
This was introduced  through the use of floral crowns, corsages, pearls, necklaces and bracelets.
Despite this, the  Neoclassical style still dominated the masculine  style. Also the introduction of a star dancer became more prominent. This was emphasized through the excess use of accesories such as a headpieces, jewellery and corsets.
</p>
     <li>Twentieth Century</li>
     <p>
       This was the revolutionary era as ballet costumes reformed again as a result of a  more liberal influence. Ballerina skirts changed to become knee-length tutus. This design  shows off the point work and multiple turns, which  forms the focus of dance practice.
In the 1920s, costume designers updated classical Russian story ballets with exotic tunics and veils wrapped around the body. Ballet dancers were dressed in loose tunics, harem pants and turbans, rather than in the established tutu and feather headdresses.


     </p>

<li>Modernism and Postmodernism</li>
<p>This period is the modernisation and liberation of ballet costumes. This means there were no longer any restrictions imposed by traditionalists expected for the design and presentation of the ballet attire. This allows ballet dancers to implement whatever style and design they want, allowing  creative freedom and sense of expression through mixing new and classical design styles.

   <h1>Contemporary Ballet </h1>
    <p>
This genre of dance incorporates elements of classical ballet and modern dance. Its technique consists of pointework ballet, although it allows a greater range of movement that cannot adhere to strict body lines set forth by schools of ballet technique. Many of its concepts are from ideas and innovations from 20th century modern dance, including floors, ballet movements and turn legs.

   <h1>Romantic Ballet </h1>
   <p>
This  Period began in the early nineteenth century and reflects the romantic ideas of art and literature at the current time. After the Classical Period, ballet became a marriage of dynamic technique and dramatic storytelling. This was the start of story ballet. The Romantic Era was a time of fantasy, etherealism, supernaturalism and exoticism. The stories of the time dealt with issues of good vs. evil, man vs. nature and society vs. the supernatural. Women became the superstars of the ballet with the introduction of pointework, a style of dancing on the tip of the toes which gave the illusion of floating. With women being centerstage, men took the role of supporting the ballerina. Important ballerinas of this era include Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Lucille Grahn and Fanny Ceritto. Popular ballets of the romantic period include La Sylphide, Giselle, and Coppelia.

   <h1>Classical Ballet </h1>
   <p>
    Classical ballet: a system of dance based on formalized movements and positions of the arms, feet, and body designed to enable the dancer to move with the greatest possible agility, control, speed, lightness, and grace. Classical-ballet technique is based on the turned-out position of the legs, which increases the range of movement through added mobility in the hip joint, and also imparts a more pleasing line to the extended leg. The subject matter of classical ballet may be romantic, realistic, or mythological; a variety of dramatic and emotional situations may be represented.

   </p>
<h1>Neoclassical Ballet </h1>
<p>
 This is a  20th century style that originates from its russian predecessor. This genre uses traditional ballet vocabulary but is less rigid than classical ballet. Neoclassical ballet is usually executed at a higher  tempo and  is more technical. The focus on structure is a defining characteristic of neoclassical dance. George Balanchine is a notary figure of neoclassical dance. Balanchine deconstructed the ballet technique, ridding the performance of dramatic sets, stories, tutus and anything else that would take the focus away from the technique and virtuosity of the dance.
